# PHP

## About
* PHP (recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a programming and scripting language to create dynamic interactive websites. WordPress is written using PHP as the scripting language. PHP is Open Source. 
* PHP is a server side programming language. 
* PHP, HTML and CSS would be used if someone wants to develop WordPress themes or plugins.
* PHP pages contain HTML with embedded code. The PHP code is enclosed in special start and end processing instructions <?php and ?> that allow you to jump into and out of PHP mode. The PHP pre-processor only processes code inside the php opening tag and closing tag.
* PHP is easy to learn, but offers many advanced features. 
* Other sites that use PHP include: Wikipedia, Yahoo, Flickr and Tumblr.
* PHP Assignment Operators. The PHP assignment operators are used with numeric values to write a value to a variable. The basic assignment operator in PHP is "=". It means that the left operand gets set to the value of the assignment expression on the right. (W3Schools)
* Variables: The $var (single dollar) is a normal variable with the name var that stores any value like string, integer, float, etc. The $$var (double dollar) is a reference variable that stores the value of the $variable inside it. (www.javatpoint.com)


## Set Up
Set up is as easy as making a folder in Visual Code and creating an index.php file. Then start writing php and html. 


## Hello World
This is the code, which, when written in a .php file will generate  "Hello, World!"

<?php
  echo "Hello, World!";
?>

Open terminal in that folder, type ```php -S localhost:8000```  You should see Hello World appear.

## Next steps
The next steps for me, for learning PHP, will be to delve further into creating an app and looking more closely at how PHP is used to build WordPress themes and plugins.
